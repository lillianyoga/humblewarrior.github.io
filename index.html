										About<br />
										Humble Warrior
									</h2>
									<p>
										Humble Warrior, or Virabhdrasana in Sanskrit, is a pose named after Virabhadra,
										a powerful warrior in Hindu mythology. Vira means hero and bradra means friend. 
										This warrior represents the destruction of evil, ignorance and delusion.
									</p>
									<p>
										We named our business Humble Warrior because a warrior, to us, represents strength and
										bravery… and a Humble Warrior is a warrior who knows where they come from.
									</p>
									<p>
										To us, yoga is not just a physical practice on a mat. It is meant to be something 
										you take with you, and shared with your community.

										May 20-May 27, 2024<br />
										Stomorska, Croatia
									</h2>
									<p>
										A yoga immersion on an island in Croatia! Join us.
									</p>
									<p>
										We will spend a week at a beach house in Croatia bathing ourselves in all things yoga. For yoga teachers, this will give you 50 hours continuing education. 
										For everyone, this will be an experience of a lifetime.
									</p>
									<p>
										Every day will start with pranayama, a yoga practice, meditation, followed by brunch. Afternoons will include a discussion about yoga philosophy or an ancient text,
										followed by pranayama and another yoga practice. We'll have chanting before dinner, and we'll end the evening with journaling, reflection, and a final meditation.
									</p>
									<p>
										The house is on the beach and also has an outdoor pool, a hot tub, and a sauna. There will be plenty of time to relax and go hiking. We will have a chef who will
										prepare nourishing and delicious meals for us.
									</p>
									<p>
										Price includes room, all meals, and all activities. 
										Price for a shared room: $2000. This house has no private bedrooms. 
									</p>

										Shane Allen
									</h2>
									<p>
										Shane is an experienced yoga teacher (E-RYT) with a speciality in meridian yoga therapy, a certified 
										Pilates mat instructor, and an Acu Detox Specialist (ADS) working in harm reduction for the city's most 
										overlooked neighbors. Additionally, he’s continuing his study at Hunter College as well as the AASECT
										recognized Sexual Health Alliance (SC). Shane originally found his way to yoga as a way to cope with 
										chronic panic attacks. Having just moved to the city for acting school, he’d learned the body tells a story. 
										Yoga taught him to listen. In his classes, Shane hopes to charm his students to meet challenges with honor, 
										humility, and humor.

									<h2>Lillian Cuthbert</h2>
									<p>
									Lillian found yoga at an early age and immediately recognized its many benefits. 
									She fell in love with the practice and the way it enhanced her life both physically 
									and mentally. She completed the 200-hour training at Yoga Vida in 2018 and further 
									studied under the guidance of her mentor, Sangeeta Vallabhan. 
									She currently has a E-RYT 500 Yoga Alliance designation. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Lillian’s classes are athletic and challenging, yet balanced, safe, and accessible to all. 
									She believes that a mindful yoga practice extends beyond the mat and infuses everything we do. 
									With that in mind, Lillian aims to have people leave her classes feeling stronger, calmer, 
									and more connected to the world around them.
								</p>
								<p>
									In 2018, Lillian climbed Mount Everest, completing the Seven 
									Summits. She has run the New York Marathon ten times, has
									qualified for and run the Boston Marathon twice. 
									She is the treasurer of <a href="https://www.thepracticecoalition.org/">
									The Practice Coalition</a>, a non-profit dedicated to providing yoga for trauma
									to survivors of domestic and sexual violence
									and to taking care of the teachers who offer it. 
									She is also the co-founder, with <a href="https://www.shanekamayoga.com/">
									Shane Allen</a>, of <a href="https://humblewarrior.studio/#">Humble Warrior</a>, 
									through which she co-organizes and co-leads retreats and teacher trainings around the globe. 
									She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering.
