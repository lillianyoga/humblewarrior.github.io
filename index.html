									<h2>
										About<br />
										Humble Warrior
									</h2>
									<p>
										Humble Warrior, or Virabhdrasana in Sanskrit, is a pose named after Virabhadra,
										a powerful warrior in Hindu mythology. Vira means hero and bradra means friend. 
										This warrior represents the destruction of evil, ignorance and delusion.
									</p>
									<p>
										We named our business Humble Warrior because a warrior, to us, represents strength and
										bravery… and a Humble Warrior is a warrior who knows where they come from.
									</p>
									<p>
										To us, yoga is not just a physical practice on a mat. It is meant to be something 
										you take with you, and shared with your community.

									</h2>
