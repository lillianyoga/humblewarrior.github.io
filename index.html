									<h2>
										About<br />
										Humble Warrior
									</h2>
									<p>
										Humble Warrior, or Virabhdrasana in Sanskrit, is a pose named after Virabhadra,
										a powerful warrior in Hindu mythology. Vira means hero and bradra means friend. 
										This warrior represents the destruction of evil, ignorance and delusion.
									</p>
									<p>
										We named our business Humble Warrior because a warrior, to us, represents strength and
										bravery… and a Humble Warrior is a warrior who knows where they come from.
									</p>
									<p>
										To us, yoga is not just a physical practice on a mat. It is meant to be something 
										you take with you, and shared with your community. 
									</p>
									<h2>
										Mission Statement <br/>
									</h2>
									<p>
										We met in the park. Humble Warrior evolved organically from our mutual reverence for the practice, 
										and also our insatiable love of play. It is our belief that these are not incompatible. That everyone 
										can enjoy their practice, and find empowerment in their own body, in their own way. Our goals include 
										inclusivity, equality, and equity for all ages, all gender identities, all colors, all ethnicities, all orientations. 
										We challenge you to take an adventure, a trip to the Self.

										January 17-24, 2025<br />
										Munnar, Kerala, India
									</h2>
									<p>
										A week-long immersion in the mountains of Munnar, India.
									</p>
									<p>
										Each day of the retreat will include two yoga classes, pranayama, meditation, inspiring 
										discussions on yoga philosophy, and time for personal reflection and journaling. In the 
										afternoons, we’ll explore the rich culture and natural beauty of the region with visits 
										to a nearby Ayurveda spa, where we’ll tour the medicinal gardens and experience rejuvenating 
										Ayurvedic massages. We’ll also enjoy traditional Kathakali and Kalaripayattu performances, 
										immerse ourselves in the local arts, and head out on scenic hikes through the landscape — 
										and with a bit of luck, we may even spot wild elephants along the way!
									</p>
									<p>
										Rounding out our team are two guest teachers joining us on this journey, Aksharanand A S and Nev Kundacina, 
										each of them offering their own individualized perspective and instruction. A great opportunity to experience yoga in its many different guises!
										The bios of each teacher is below.
									</p>
									<p>
										Price includes shared accommodation in a hotel, two meals a day, and all activities. 
										Airfare and travel to and from the location is not included. 
										The house does not have yoga equipment, so you will need to bring your own mat, and anything else you like to use while
										practicing. We will do yoga at the hotel.
										Price: $2500. $2000 for those that have taken a retreat with us before.
