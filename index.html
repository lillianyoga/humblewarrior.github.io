									<h2>
										About<br />
										Humble Warrior
									</h2>
									<p>
										Humble Warrior, or Virabhdrasana in Sanskrit, is a pose named after Virabhadra,
										a powerful warrior in Hindu mythology. Vira means hero and bradra means friend. 
										This warrior represents the destruction of evil, ignorance and delusion.
									</p>
									<p>
										We named our business Humble Warrior because a warrior, to us, represents strength and
										bravery… and a Humble Warrior is a warrior who knows where they come from.
									</p>
									<p>
										To us, yoga is not just a physical practice on a mat. It is meant to be something 
										you take with you, and shared with your community. 
									</p>
									<h2>
										Mission Statement <br/>
									</h2>
									<p>
										We met in the park. Humble Warrior evolved organically from our mutual reverence for the practice, 
										and also our insatiable love of play. It is our belief that these are not incompatible. That everyone 
										can enjoy their practice, and find empowerment in their own body, in their own way. Our goals include 
										inclusivity, equality, and equity for all ages, all gender identities, all colors, all ethnicities, all orientations. 
										We challenge you to take an adventure, a trip to the Self.

									<!-- SANGEETA -->
									<img class="image fit" src="images/sangeeta.png"/>
									<p>
										<strong>Sangeeta Vallabhan</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Sangeeta has been studying movement since she was young, first through dance and then yoga. She has been teaching yoga in New York City
										since 2003. She has studied vinyasa, prenatal, restorative, advanced vinyasa, trauma informed yoga and yoga philosophy. In total she has
										studied over 1200 hours. She trains teachers at the 200hr and 300hr levels. She has taught yoga nationally and internationally; she has

										in trauma informed yoga with her own training, Solemarch - Yoga for Trauma Yoga Teacher Training. In 2020, she founded a non-profit, The
										Practice Coalition, an organization dedicated to supporting survivors of domestic and sexual violence with yoga for trauma. Sangeeta aims

									<p>
										<strong>Tonie Warner</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Tonie found empowerment and refuge in Yoga in over 15 years of practice and teaching.  She believes that Yoga is a liberation practice, 
										dependent on the liberation of BIPOC.  She did not see this tenet being upheld in dominant studio culture, and with the desire to extend
										her practice in alignment with her beliefs, she founded Yuja Soul, a dedicated space offering Yoga for Black Women.  In addition to Yuja 
										Soul, Tonie is also a Principal at The Practice Coalition, a non-profit organization that offers Yoga for trauma to survivors of domestic
										and sexual violence.  
									</p>
									<p>
										Tonie is currently a full-time Yoga Teacher and Teacher Trainer, who can be found leading practice through Brooklyn and New York City.
										Her classes are inspired by the Advaita Vedanta philosophy of non-duality, and are known for their physical and mental challenge, and open
										brave space for inquiry and experiencing at the intersections of Yoga philosophy, social justice and healing justice.  These inspirations are
										also threaded into her Prenatal Yoga offerings and post-natal offering, <i>Parents and Baby</i>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Tonie is grateful for her teachers, having completed her 200 and 300 hour trainings at Sonic Yoga, her Prenatal Yoga training with Clare
										Ryan through Yoga Vida and Somatics and Attachment Therapy with The Embody Lab.  Tonie carries the teachings of her ancestors and elders,
										and is inspired by the thought and work of bell hooks, Toni Morrison, adrienne maree brown, Tias Little and Gabor Maté.
